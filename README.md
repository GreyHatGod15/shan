# Shan - An new beginner level programming language

#### developed by juice.42web.io
Hello, I am Drags from juice.io, and this is my programming language I made as a project using python. I have plans to make the same with same syntaxes in C. Thanks!

## Syntaxes
#### syntax highlighting is python as I cant to it anyways!

### print \<arg\>
print is a basic command to print something onto the console.
example: 
I want to write the sentence "Bob has 29 apples" onto the console.
In python its:
```python
print("Bob has 29 apples")
```
In shan, its kind of similar:
```python
print Bob has 29 apples
```

### input \<arg\>
input is also like python, it is used to take argument from user.
example:
I want to ask the user how many apples bob has.
In python its:
```python
input("How many apples does bob have?: ")
```
shan: 
```python
input how many apples does bob have?: 
```
